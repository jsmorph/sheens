# Javascript Sheens implementation

Extracted from
[`github.com/Comcast/littlesheens`](https://github.com/Comcast/littlesheens),
which wraps a C API around this Javascript implementation.

This code works with [Duktape](https://duktape.org/), which can give
you a full Sheens implementation in 400KB (along with a decent sandbox
for your actions).
